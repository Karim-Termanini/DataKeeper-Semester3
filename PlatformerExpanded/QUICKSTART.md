## Tips

1. **Use double jump** to avoid enemies and projectiles
2. **Dash** to quickly escape dangerous situations
3. **Build combos** by landing consecutive attacks for more damage
4. **Jump on enemies** to avoid damage and gain height
5. **Keep moving** - standing still makes you an easy target
6. **Watch the timer** - you only need to survive, not kill all enemies
7. **Use slide attacks** to pass under projectiles
