## Game Mechanics

### Survival Timer
- Each level has a specific duration
- Timer counts down in real-time
- When timer reaches 0:
  - Enemy spawning stops
  - All remaining enemies despawn
  - Exit portal appears at arena center

### Enemy Spawning
- Enemies spawn at intervals based on level configuration
- Spawn locations are randomized at arena edges
- Spawning continues until level enemy cap is reached
- Spawning stops when timer completes

### Enemy AI Behavior
- **Detection**: Enemies detect player within 600 pixels
- **Chase**: Move towards player at speed 2.0
- **Attack**: When within 150 pixels, stop and attack
- **Cooldown**: 60 frames between attacks (0.5 seconds at 120 FPS)

### Combat System
- **Combo System**: Chain attacks for increased damage
- **Invincibility Frames**: Brief protection during certain actions
- **Jump Over**: Jump on enemies to avoid damage
- **Slide Attack**: Low-profile movement with damage
